<p>We live in a world where the change is the only constant and customers are in-charge. Innovations in technology are fundamentally changing the way we interact with the world around us and changing what citizens expect from the government. Incremental adaptation to technical change and disruption is no longer enough and federal organizations must take positive steps to keep pace with innovation and change.  The federal government is often perceived as being behind the digital innovation curve, taking significantly longer to adopt web-based solutions than the private sector, with less enthusiasm and skill. But in recent years, several initiatives undertaken by federal, state, and local agencies are challenging that perception.Creating and optimizing digital services has become a top priority for governments in recent years. The factors driving this change are varied. Legislative mandates (such as the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular 11 mandating incremental development), combined with evolving citizen expectations, changing technological, social, political and cultural landscapes are forcing federal agencies to consider broader digital transformation to become Agile, data-driven organizations. Customer experience (CX) focused digital transformation enables federal agencies to provide services that meet the evolving expectations of citizens and businesses, even in a period of tight budgets and complex challenges such as income inequality, geopolitical instability, and aging populations.<br />

</div>
<p>While digital transformation is multifaceted and complex, the continuing trends from last year and first three months of 2018 gives us a peek into the main themes of transformation in the U.S. government, more specifically the Federal government. Here are our top six digital transformation trends that continue to shape the priorities in the public sector.</p>
<h2>1. Agility as Core</h2>
<p>Agile approach to developing software iteratively and incrementally is a universally accepted norm for technology-related projects from developing a website, a business application or a full-fledged platform with all the bells and whistles. Agile has become not just an option for software development, but the only way to develop software &#8211; while continuously delivering value to users. An Agile mindset and culture, however, is a whole different story &#8211; and requires a new Agile operating model to be adopted across an enterprise. The key characteristics of this new operating model include focus on collaboration between business and IT, failing fast and bouncing back, learning through discovery, focus on customer experience and striving for continuous delivery of value to stakeholders. While many organizations in the private sector are embracing this operating model, the federal sector is fast-realizing that an Agile mindset is an absolute necessity when dealing with a mixed workforce of employees and multiple-levels of contactors, and mammoth multi-year projects. Furthermore, ever expanding priorities for a federal CIO organization such as OMB mandates (Cloud-First, Shared Services, Incremental Development, etc.), implementation of Technology Business Management (TBM) initiatives, ensuring good scores on Federal IT Acquisition Reform Act (FITARA) Scorecard, evaluating the impact of Modernizing Government Technology Act (MGT) on their portfolio/investments are pushing federal CIOs to question the status-quo and think about transforming the IT organizations to eliminate the silos between business and IT. Federal agencies are taking note of this need and are putting the building blocks in place for a broader transformation and adoption of Agile mindset/culture across the organization. While the level of Agility (maturity of implementation of the Agile operating model) varies from agency to agency, we expect to see more agencies start the journey to embrace Agility as the core characteristic of their operating models.</p>
<h2>2. Optimized Operations</h2>
<p>Federal organizations are leveraging technologies such as Cloud computing, Containerized deployments (Docker), DevOps, and Automation (Ansible, Chef, Puppet, etc.) to fundamentally change the way infrastructure and operations are managed.  DevOps based operational structures are streamlining development, integration, testing and deployment activities using automated tools and are eliminating silos between development and infrastructure operations. Agencies that adopted Agile and DevOps as a way to develop and deploy software are not only delivering value to customers in frequent intervals but are also leveraging automation configuration management and continuous integration/deployment to optimize operations. Cloud computing brought some sweeping and much-needed changes to the way infrastructure is procured, managed and monitored in the federal government. Cloud platforms such as Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure are making it’s easier for agencies to acquire secure infrastructure resources quickly and scale on demand. <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/digital-strategy/federal-cloud-computing-strategy.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">The Cloud First Policy</a> was released by The White House in 2011, “to accelerate the pace at which the Federal Government realizes the value of Cloud Computing. This policy is an important aspect of the government reform efforts working to achieve operational efficiencies by adopting &#8220;light&#8221; technology and shared services.” Almost seven years since this manifesto was released, federal agencies are increasing the pace of adoption, with the Department of Defense (DOD), General Services Administration (GSA), and several others issuing acquisition notices to acquire secure cloud-based products and services.  Even though agencies are still facing hurdles in deploying cloud-based solutions some seven years after the cloud-first policy, several agencies are breaking through the barriers by moving beyond deploying email in the cloud. An interagency working group called Cloud Center of Excellence (CCoE) kicked off in January 2017 with an aim to provide agencies with advice on best practices for cloud adoption (more than 140 participants as of September 2017). Furthermore, according to Deltek GovWin, there was strong jump in cloud related contract awards in federal civilian market in 2017, which saw a total contract value rise to about $3.2B. Cloud awards look set to accelerate sharply from this year onward, particularly if proposed cuts to civilian agency budgets go into effect. We expect this trend to continue and more agencies will be leveraging public and/or private clouds to run their business operations and customer facing workloads.</p>
<h2>3. Innovative Acquisitions</h2>
<p>Federal acquisition is not known to be an innovative function even though federal government is a procurement heavy space. It’s encouraging to see that federal procurement is going through a wave of digital transformation of its own, starting with leveraging big data analytics for making more data driven decisions to experimenting with Blockchain to automate procurement functions. The traditional practice of the government spending months or years writing down requirements for a potential software development effort and then requesting potential competitors to submit long proposals with their approach and price is slowly changing and giving way to more innovative procurement practices. Over the past two to three years, we have seen a rise in “alternate” acquisition practices that are prioritizing “seeing” the capability of a vendor instead of “reading” about it in a long proposal. Several procurements from U.S. Census Bureau, for instance, asked the vendors to present their approach to a panel instead of submitting a traditional proposal. Some agencies are also buying fixed number of sprints/iterations with a pre-specified amount of velocity instead of simply specifying scope and expecting the service provider to deliver. Other acquisitions from organizations such as 18F and United States Digital Service (USDS) leveraged more hands-on approaches such as hackathons to base awards on working software than a lengthy proposal.</p>
<p>Some agencies are leveraging alternate acquisition vehicles called “Other Transaction Authority” (OTA) agreements more extensively to acquire innovative technology services and products as these agreements enable agencies bypass some of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) laws and rules and create custom acquisition vehicles. OTAs were pioneered in part by the Defense Innovation Unit Experimental (DIUx), an innovation hub that is created to court nontraditional defense companies in Silicon Valley and other tech savvy cities. <a href="https://federalnewsradio.com/acquisition/2017/10/ota-contracts-are-the-new-cool-thing-in-dod-acquisition/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">The Defense Department (DoD) has already jumped on OTA train</a> and the use of OTAs doubled from 2015 to 2016 and grew another nearly 50 percent the next year. with over $2 billion worth of acquisitions in OTAs in 2017 alone. There are also efforts underway in the federal government to leverage innovative technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning and blockchain to fundamentally change the way federal government acquires services from the industry. There are several innovative prototypes in progress to test the feasibility of using a promising ledger technology such as blockchain including <a href="https://federalnewsradio.com/it-modernization-2017/2017/11/gsa-experimenting-with-blockchain-to-cut-contracting-time/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">this pilot by GSA</a>. Despite these initiatives and growing number of success stories, progress and innovation in acquisition offices across federal sector has been patchy and fragmented. We expect the impetus created by Modernization of Government Technology act (MGT), combined with the momentum in the market place aided by digital technologies will continue to promote innovation and push the envelope in federal procurement practices.</p>
<h2>4. Modernization of IT</h2>
<p>The recently announced <a href="https://www.fedscoop.com/trump-signs-mgt-act-law/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Modernizing Government Technology (MGT) Act</a> created additional impetus to creating more robust citizen experiences and gives agencies resources to modernize, move to cloud, implement shared services, and improve their cyber defenses. Furthermore, the federal government is trying to propel technology modernization through a “Centers of Excellence” (CoE) model that will aim at pushing agencies’ networks and systems to adopt cloud and shared services. United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) will be the first agency to pilot this model in partnership with General Services Administration’s (GSA) Technology Transformation Service (TTS) with CoE around five areas &#8211; Cloud Adoption, IT infrastructure Optimization, Customer Experience, Service Delivery Analytics and Contact Centers. One of the key goals of this modernization effort is to use the concept of CoEs to improve customer experience across the federal government and transform federal agencies into effective, efficient, and customer-focused organizations. A combination of the OMB mandates such as Shared Services, Cloud-First, etc. and other legislative initiatives such as FITARA, TBM and MGT are changing the role of a federal CIO from a technology service provider and enforcer of enterprise governance to a facilitator and enabler of business objectives. FITARA not only gave budgeting power to CIOs, but also enabled IT to align much more closely with the mission objectives by gaining a seat at the “enterprise table”. In addition, technology innovations in cloud, Artificial Intelligence, Blockchain, etc. are forcing the IT organization and CIO to work closely with business to figure out the solutions that best align with business objectives and customer experience goals.</p>
<h2>5. Focus on Customer Experience</h2>
<p>Providing excellent services to citizens, businesses and other organizations is at the core of most federal agencies’ missions. Citizens are increasingly demanding the same level of customer experience from government agencies that they receive from private sector companies like Uber and Amazon. Whether ordering a ride on demand from their smartphones or products for same-day delivery from Alexa, customers — employees, partners, and citizens alike — have growing expectations for fast, seamless, personalized and unified CX. Crafting optimal Customer Experiences (CX) is both an art and science and the Federal Government is striving to create more user-centric services and tools for its workforce and citizens alike. Designing effective customer experiences more than just creating “user-centric” interfaces and starts with deeper, more complete understanding of “customers” through techniques such as Design Thinking.</p>
<p>Late last year, senate passed an amended version of the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/1088" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Customer Experience Act of 2017</a>bill that that expresses &#8220;the sense of Congress that all agencies should strive to provide high-quality, courteous, effective, and efficient services and seek to measure, collect, report, and utilize metrics relating to the experience of persons interacting with them to continually improve services.”. Organizations such as 18F and United States Digital Service (USDS) are changing the way government services are provided to citizens by offering best practices, playbooks and other practical guidance to agencies. For instance, the <a href="https://playbook.cio.gov/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Digital Services Playbook</a> by USDS offers 13 key plays drawn from successful practices from the private sector and government organizations, if followed, can help improve customer experience across agencies. ACT-IAC, an industry-government collaboration and advocacy community organization, is actively working on releasing a <a href="https://www.actiac.org/customer-experience-cx-playbook-project" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">playbook</a> that provides best practices based, actionable guidance to federal agencies on how to offer better experiences to citizens. DigitalGov.gov offers a <a href="https://www.digitalgov.gov/resources/customer-experience-toolkit/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Customer Experience Toolkit</a> and a whole host of resources for creating a CX strategy, its implementation, rollout, how to measure customer satisfaction and how to act on the data collected. Agencies are starting to look at the citizen’s experience more comprehensively than just the touch points —along the entire journey taken—to really understand how to improve experience, engagement and customer satisfaction meaningfully. Customer experience driven digital transformation can fundamentally change the way federal agencies operate by enabling the agencies to create solutions and products that, first and foremost, solve/address the needs of the customer.</p>
<h2>6. Continuous Security</h2>
<p>We live in an era when no discussion about digital transformation and optimal user experience is complete without talking about security. Cybersecurity attacks are a form of 21st century warfare that is forcing governments to work around the clock to protect citizen data and infrastructure. With citizens’ increased virtual presence and the large amount of highly sensitive information now stored online, all sectors continue to make improvements to cyber security and protection. There is increasing awareness that any technology initiative or project needs to take a security-fist approach and recent attacks on government <a href="https://www.welivesecurity.com/2018/02/12/government-websites-mine-cryptocurrency/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">websites</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/oct/10/deloitte-hack-hit-server-containing-emails-from-across-us-government" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">servers</a> are providing more impetus for security management and monitoring to be more continuous. For instance, DHS has doubled down on addressing <a href="https://fedtechmagazine.com/article/2018/03/dhs-targets-cybersecurity-risks-it-supply-chains" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">cybersecurity risks in IT supply chains</a> after the recent news that Russian hackers had penetrated United States power grids. Furthermore, the rise of the Internet of Things (IoT), blockchain and other emerging technologies adds several challenges to the digital security landscape. Agile development and DevOps processes are changing the way developers handle security by introducing security control awareness early in the project lifecycle and reducing the downstream risk by automating configuration management through tools such as Ansible, Chef and Puppet. Furthermore, several cloud-based infrastructure monitoring and management tool vendors are offering innovative security solutions such as continuous threat monitoring using Artificial Intelligence and advanced analytics that process data and identify potential threats in real-time. We expect these trends to continue and security to be at the forefront of all digital transformation initiatives in any federal agency.</p>
<h2>Parting thoughts&#8230;</h2>
<p>Federal agencies have long ways to go in their efforts to transform themselves to be more Agile, data-driven organizations. However, there are already multiple initiatives underway as illustrated by some of the trends outlined above and it is encouraging to see federal government moving in the right direction. By taking steps now to better understand customers, collect data and provide actionable insights to employees on the front lines, federal agencies may be better prepared to comply with possible legislative mandates and help their agencies lower costs, inspire employees, achieve mission objectives and enhance citizen experiences.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="300" height="100" src="https://www.LoisLabs.com/app/uploads/2018/07/enterprise-software.png" class="attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image" alt="Enterprise Software Graphic" /></p><div style="font-size: 18px; font-family: Lato; text-align: justify;">
<p>In a recent conversation about implementing Agile and DevOps in an organization, our group stumbled into the the question of “Common Platforms” &#8211; more specifically, &#8220;are common platforms (Tools, technologies, architectures, solutions) helpful or detrimental to a team’s agility in an Agile operating environment?”. There were plenty of opinions in the room — as seems to be the case these days with any discussion related to Agile and DevOps — and the general opinion of the group was that common platforms would constrain a team’s ability to innovate quickly and are fundamentally antithetic to the principles of Agile. On the surface, this position seems rather puristic in nature and seem to ignore the practical operational trade-offs an organization needs to make in order to meet many of its conflicting/competing priorities.<br />
<span id="more-3530"></span></p>
<ul>
<li>What is the importance, if any, of common platforms and solutions in an Agile operating environment?</li>
<li>Do common solutions — technologies, platforms and tools really stifle innovation?</li>
<li>Can we empower teams while still setting guardrails around tools and technologies the teams can use?</li>
<li>What is the role of Enterprise Architecture (EA) and technical governance in an Agile/DevOps driven world?</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to discuss this topic effectively, we need to first address the role of EA and Governance in Agile. Scaled Agile Framework (<a href="http://www.scaledagileframework.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">SAFe</a>) defines a layered model of Agile adaptation across the enterprise and defines the role of Enterprise Architect as “The Enterprise Architect promotes adaptive design, and engineering practices and drives architectural initiatives for the portfolio. Enterprise Architects also facilitate the reuse of ideas, components, services, and proven patterns across various solutions in a portfolio”. The second part of the above set of sentences is of particular interest and relevance here. One of the key responsibilities of EA has been ensuring teams are developing business solutions using standardized toolset, architecture patterns and components/services, while creating common business solutions when/where possible. Enterprise Architects view all artifacts (systems, platforms, solutions, tools, etc.) with an enterprise wide lens and work with system architects and business owners/portfolio managers to ensure implementations are in alignment with organizational objectives. As shown in Figure 1 below, EA typically sits between the program and portfolio layers in a traditional organization or often completely in the portfolio/enterprise layer, and only engages with the teams on the ground (that are actually delivering actionable functionality to users) when the teams come to them for architecture/technical governance reviews and/or architecture exceptions.</p>
<div id="attachment_3532" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.LoisLabs.com/app/uploads/2018/07/agile-ea-common-platforms.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3532" class="wp-image-3532" src="http://www.LoisLabs.com/app/uploads/2018/07/agile-ea-common-platforms.png" alt="Enterprise Agile Operational Model" width="600" height="430" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-3532" class="wp-caption-text">An Enterprise Agile Operational Model (Inspired by concepts from SAFe)</p></div>
<p>While the importance and relevance of EA’s role is no different under the Agile umbrella, the traditional model of disconnected, fragmented engagement between EA and implementation teams is not effective and does not produce the desirable results. One change, I would argue, that needs to be made to this layered model in Figure 1 above is the addition of a dotted line between EA, System Architects (in Program layer) and Dev Teams &#8211; thus ensuring there is close, continuous collaboration between implementation teams and technical governance teams. EA’s role in an Agile model changes from that of an enforcer to that of a collaborator, facilitator, aggregator and mediator. Changes in technological, political, economic, competitive landscapes and other factors often push businesses in directions beyond the scope of Agile Teams. Enterprise Architects can provide the strategic technical direction needed to stay in tight alignment with changing business objectives that can improve results across multiple Agile teams. Aspects of this strategy may include recommendations for development and delivery of common platforms, components, technology stacks, APIs, interoperability standards, hosting strategies, etc. among others. Furthermore, in an Agile enterprise, some of the responsibilities that have typically been associated with EA are now delegated to the team level. Teams are expected to ensure their solutions align with user needs and business objectives, while continuously delivering value to their customers. However, the context within which teams typically make decisions is very “localized” to the teams and they typically do not have visibility over the decisions being made by other teams within a program and/or portfolio. According to SAFe’s layered organization model, it is the responsibility of Program and Portfolio teams to ensure capabilities created by teams in the lower levels are integrated into a broader operational instruments such as Program Increments (PI) or Release Trains (RT).</p>
<p>Giving autonomy to development teams does not mean that they should or get to pick their own tools and technologies, while completely ignoring the tools and technologies other teams in the rest of the organization are using. In the new normal of Lean, Agile and DevOps driven operational environment, I would argue that it’s the concepts and principles teams follow that have more impact on the eventual outcomes than the tools and technologies themselves. For instance, does a team get to say they would like to deploy their app on Google Cloud where as the organization is moving towards using AWS as the standard cloud provider? Does a team get to pick their own configuration management and automation tool such as Chef or Puppet while rest of the org is using Ansible? Appropriate answer here is that it depends on the impact of that decision and the context around it. As a general rule, it’s important to have common solutions at the enterprise level (such as AWS and Ansible) so that you can standardize operating environment, skill sets, processes, etc. — but have enough flexibility in the governance model to allow deviations from those standards when needed. Perhaps the team has a legitimate reason to want to use a different tool or move to a different cloud provider. The point here is <strong><em>not</em></strong> that we should eliminate all guard rails and governance structures to enable a team to do that &#8211; but rather that we should be making those governance processes much more collaborative and agile so that these decisions, which typically get mired in the bureaucracy of EA approvals/denials, can be made quickly and radiated to the rest of the organization. In an Agile operation model, the role of EA and subsequently the role of common solutions is to provide those guardrails, while enabling teams to deviate from these guardrails when warranted by the business and solution context.</p>
<blockquote><p> EA’s role in an Agile model changes from an enforcer to a collaborator, facilitator, aggregator and mediator.</p></blockquote>
<p>Organizations embarking on Agile transformation journey should consider the following five critical components to ensure they are striking a sound balance between standardization (common platforms), governance and innovation/team empowerment.</p>
<h3><strong>1. Establish Key Architecture Principles as Guardrails</strong></h3>
<p>Establish architecture principles to drive the overall architecture context for guiding implementations across the enterprise. For instance “Open Source First”, “Common Business Solutions”, “Integrated Security”, “Adapt DevSecOps”, “Layered, Loosely-coupled Architectures”, etc. provide high level guidance and guardrails for the teams to work within. These principles will ensure Agile teams do not stray too far away from business objectives in the name of agility and innovation.</p>
<h3><strong>2. Create Reference Architectures and Evolve through an Architecture Runway </strong></h3>
<p>Establish and document reference architectures when/where applicable to capture best practices, patterns and services at the enterprise level. Drive architecture implementation through an enterprise level architecture backlog so that individual implementation teams have enough runway to rollout their solutions at any point in time. Leverage architecture/design spikes to explore new concepts, tools and technologies to reduce the risk of solution implementation at a team level.</p>
<h3><strong>3. Promote Common Solutions and Platforms</strong></h3>
<p>Identify, establish and promote common solutions (Services, Components, APIs, tools, platforms and technologies) to reduce duplication. Provide guardrails and guidelines relative to common tools and technologies to teams, while actively engaging the teams to understand their needs and incorporating the feedback into common solutions. Promote REST based APIs to increase agility of solution implementations.</p>
<h3><strong>4. Position EA as Collaborator and Facilitator &#8211; not as an Enforcer </strong></h3>
<p>Ensure EA engages with implementation teams early and often, disseminating information from the enterprise view and collect feedback to refine enterprise level artifacts. Enterprise architects must work closely with System Architects and implementation teams to ensure they are enabling the careful balance needed between autonomy and governance. The mission remains the same — but the process, approach and tools now are different. EA can no longer be effective in its traditional enforcer role &#8211; and needs to become an aggregator, observer, facilitator and disseminator of information across multiple teams.</p>
<h3><strong>5. Establish/follow an Agile Governance Model</strong></h3>
<p>Align governance model with Agile implementation model. Adapt multiple engagement models to monitor and observe compliance in Agile teams instead of waiting for the teams to engage EA for technical governance. Implement processes with quick turn around time to eliminate roadblocks and obstacles. Primary goal of the new EA is to be nimble and responsive to the needs of the teams on the ground, while ensuring solution implementations are in alignment with customer/business objectives.</p>
<p>A careful orchestration of governance and team autonomy is required to ensure teams have the ability to innovate (if that requires new tools and technologies) while still collaborating with EA and leveraging enterprise level common solutions as much as possible. In cases where a complete departure from enterprise guidelines is required, orgs need to ensure that the governance processes in place are Agile enough to enable teams and EA to respond and address the scenario and make decisions quickly. In an ideal world, we perhaps do not need the EA function altogether &#8211; in a world where the teams are empowered to operate with complete authority, independence and accountability. Until then &#8211; during this transition and transformation period &#8211; we still need EA to act as a facilitator, aggregator and collaborator — and help minimize risk, manage cost, build capabilities at an enterprise level, while ensuring the implementations and technology choices are in alignment with business objectives.</p>

<p>World is changing around us. Technological innovation driven by cloud, mobile, social, data and IoT is impacting the way we live, work and play. The pace of technological innovation has increased over the past few years and is accelerating fueled by the innovation created in the digital networks. Current rate of technology innovation is perhaps the most dramatic and disruptive since the industrial revolution. Technologies such as Cloud Computing, Mobility, Internet of Connected Things, Connected Homes and Cars, and Wearables are impacting the way consumers interact with the world around them and this in turn is impacting the very core business models of each business. Consumers in almost all industries are becoming increasing tech savvy and demanding digital solutions from businesses. No organization and business are immune to change any more as changing technologies and consumer behavior are demanding a change and fundamental transformation in how businesses operate in this new normal where change is the only constant.<span id="more-3524"></span></p>
<p>As digital technologies continue to disrupt every industry, there are only two types of organizations – those that have been reshaped by digital technology, and those that soon will be. New competitors are emerging in every industry and traditional organizations are transforming themselves into digital organizations using Social, Mobile, Analytics, Cloud, Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), Blockchain and more to offer new digital experiences to their customers.  Through digital transformation, organizations can offer products, services and value to customers, patients and citizens that were not even imagined just a few years ago. A truly digital enterprise does more than use new technology – it replaces old operating models with digital models that can be incorporated into product platforms and operations.  Becoming a 21st century digital enterprise requires a strategy that enables continuous delivery of digital capabilities at the speed of the business.</p>
<div style="font-family: Oswald, serif; font-size: 36px; font-weight: 900;">Drivers and Enablers</div>
<p>Digital technologies &#8211; Social, Mobile, Analytics, Cloud and Internet of Things (SMACT) &#8211; are driving innovation and change across all industries and are acting as technology enablers to move the digital transformation forward. In addition, gigantic shifts in customer behavior caused by economic, cultural and political changes are driving multiple economies across consumer and business segments.</p>
<div style="font-family: Lato; font-size: 28px; font-weight: bold;">Data Economy &#8211; Intelligent Enterprise</div>
<p>Researchers report that more data has been created in the last two years than in all of human history, and market research firm IDC notes in 2014, the digital universe equaled 1.7 megabytes a minute for every person on Earth. IDC predicts the total size of the digital universe will reach 44 zettabytes of data in 2020. Roughly 10 percent of that data will come from 32 billion connected devices—more than twice as many as there are now.With the influx of large amounts of data from multiple traditional and modern channels, advances in processing power, lowering of barriers in processing large data sets, reduction in cost of storage and advances in data science organizations are able to leverage software/machines to help them make more informed decisions. In this deeply data driven model, organizations can readily exploit actionable insights from data to drive better business outcomes across the enterprise.</p>
<div style="font-family: Lato; font-size: 28px; font-weight: bold;">Experience Economy &#8211; Smarter Consumer</div>
<p>Big data analytics combined with the proliferation of mobile and wearable devices are allowing businesses to craft experiences that are unique and personalized to each user.  Personalized, unified User experience across multiple channels (web, mobile, wearables, connected cars, connected homes and other smart objects) is key to engage consumers and gain competitive advantage.</p>
<p>All types of businesses, not just technology companies are using personalization to provide context rich experiences to the consumer. This means all features and functionality built into any product must reflect what individuals are trying to accomplish, enabling them to control and automate parts of their lives in both physical and digital worlds. Customer demand for outcome based, personalized, integrated experience is driving innovation towards solutions than products. Organizations can gain quantifiable, end to end insights into the outcomes their customers are trying to achieve and use those insights to develop significantly more effective solutions.</p>
<div style="font-family: Lato; font-size: 28px; font-weight: bold;">Mobile Economy &#8211; Ubiquitous Computing</div>
<p>It is estimated that 50 billion devices connected to the internet by 2020 (source:Cisco) with a total potential economic impact in the order of $4Trillion to $14 Trillion across all industries by 2025 (Source: McKinsey, Cisco).  Internet of Connected Things has the potential to fundamentally shift the way we interact with our surroundings. The ability to monitor and manage objects in the physical world electronically makes it possible to bring data-driven decision making to new realms of human activity—to optimize the performance of systems and processes, save time for people and businesses, and improve quality of life.</p>
<p>With 5.2B mobile users across the world (source:Internet Trends 2015, KPCB.com), Mobile has become the new de-facto access point and combined with Cloud computing has led to true ubiquitous computing.  The processing power of the average smartphone has increased by about 25 percent per year over the past five years, and the latest processors can adeptly juggle multiple resource-intensive applications and produce vivid graphics.  The mobile Internet is also being offered in entirely new formats, such as wearable devices.  In coming years, mobile Internet devices will be smaller, far more powerful, more intuitive, wearable, and packed with many types of sensors.</p>
<div style="font-family: Lato; font-size: 28px; font-weight: bold;">API and App Economy &#8211; Software Driven Organization</div>
<p>Software is eating the world and every business is being forced to become a software business. As more products become smart and connected, software is emerging as the connective tissue for value creation, even for companies that sell physical goods. Intelligent applications are a playing critical role in driving business decisions across all types of businesses influencing how these businesses interact with their customers, how they buy and sell products or services and how they find their next product insights.</p>
<p>Furthermore, innovations in technologies such as Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, and Cognitive Computing are changing the way consumer and enterprise software is developed. These technologies, in conjunction with new user interface formats such as gesture, touch and voice, are opening a new world of possibilities for software developers.  <strong><em>Modern software is smarter, connected, mobile-friendly, cloud operated, social aware, API based and user focused</em></strong>.</p>
<p>However, to compete with agility and speed, companies can no longer afford complex, lengthy and expensive coding of applications, or massive, multi-year system implementations. What’s needed is a new way to build software—faster, flexible and more agile—with reusable components that allow for rapid assembly of applications in support of dynamic business needs. This approach requires an Agile approach to development, DevOps culture, modular and micro-service based architectures, next-generation integration techniques and a cloud-first, mobile-first and API-first mindset.</p>
<div style="font-family: Oswald; font-size: 36px; font-weight: 900;">The Next Generation Organization &#8211; Agile, Data-Driven and Powered by Software</div>
<div><a href="http://www.LoisLabs.com/app/uploads/2015/07/next-gen-enterprise-large.png"><img class=" size-thumbnail wp-image-2833 aligncenter" src="http://www.LoisLabs.com/app/uploads/2015/07/next-gen-enterprise-small.png" alt="next-gen-enterprise-1-01" width="700" height="450" /></a></div>
<p>We believe that in order to get ahead in todays hyper-connected digital world, every business needs to become a <strong>digital business</strong> with the appropriate tools, processes, mechanisms and digital channels in place to reach the customer, all aligned to a business strategy focused on customer experience and agility.  All layers of a traditional business including marketing, management, employee engagement, customer acquisition, infrastructure, must be evaluated and transformed to meet the challenges of the digital world.  The traditional approach of let’s define a “target state” and create a “roadmap” to get there does not work any more. Organizations need a transformation strategy that is rooted in incremental, iterative, agile transformation with a firm focus on measurable results &#8211; the “target state” will continue to evolve influenced by changing business conditions, customer behavior and technological innovation.  An ideal transformation effort will consider all these factors and lay out a roadmap that addresses the question &#8211; “where do I start and how do I become agile enough to be able to react to changing market conditions”.</p>
<p>The principles of integrated customer experience, agility, transparency and collaborative culture, combined with an approach that provides measurable progress through innovation, prototypes and continuous delivery will enable organizations to re-design business models, re-imagine user experiences and evolve into digital businesses. Furthermore, organizations need a partner that can bring together the creative and technology capabilities, business acumen, and industry insight needed to transform the organization into a 21st century digital business.</p>
